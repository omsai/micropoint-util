MicroPoint Power Conversion Utility
===================================

This is a [slide rule](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slide_rule) GUI utility for traversing the logarithmic laser power scales particular to the [Andor MicroPoint](http://www.andor.com/microscopy-systems/active-illumination/micropoint).

Usage
-----
Change the value of `Index` (you can use the mouse wheel) and Attenuator `Type`.

Goals
-----
This program was written to provide:
* *Unified view of power scale:*
  Most software show either the linear scale or the logarithmic index.  This utility shows both.
* *Manual attenuator powers:*
  No software shows the manual attenuator linear scale.
